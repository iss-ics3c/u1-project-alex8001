            <p>Employment rate has gone up in quadruple digits from 2016, or 6 years ago.  There are likely to be several more positions available in the near future due to this drastic uprise, however, a moderate amount of graphic designers become eventually unemployed. Opportunities in this job are expected to increase with the rise of technological advance with corporation and businesses. There is expected to be a demand towards more graphic designers in the future, however it is currently considered a saturated market and college students going into graphic design are encouraged to seek a more stable source of income. Graphic designers have a higher source of full-time workers rather than part-time. Approximately 65% of graphic designers work all year in comparison to 35% working part of the year and those working for the entire year average about 32 weeks. It is labeled as having a fair outlook by jobbank.gc.ca in respect to ontario’s economic regions.</p>
